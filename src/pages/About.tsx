            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Picthesia was born from a simple yet powerful idea: what if every word could instantly become visual? We believe that learning should be engaging, accessible, and memorable. By combining text with relevant images, we're making education more visual, one word at a time.</p>
